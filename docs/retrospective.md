# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Summary
The sprint was highly successful, delivering all planned features for the TaskFlow MVP. The BMAD multi-agent approach proved effective in parallelizing planning and execution, leading to rapid development.

## What Went Well
*   **Agent Collaboration:** The agents seamlessly integrated their outputs, from PRD to code and tests.
*   **Clear Architecture:** The initial architecture plan was robust, allowing the Dev Agent to implement features without significant roadblocks.
*   **Automated Artifact Generation:** The automated creation of documents, stories, and code structure accelerated the entire process.

## What Could Be Improved
*   **Frontend Implementation:** The frontend was deferred. In the next cycle, a dedicated Dev Agent for the frontend could work in parallel with the backend agent.
*   **Environment Setup:** Initial shell command compatibility issues caused minor delays. Standardizing the execution environment would be beneficial.

## Action Items
*   Initiate a parallel track for frontend development in the next phase.
*   Create a standardized environment setup script for all agents.
